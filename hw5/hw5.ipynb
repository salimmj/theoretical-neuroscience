    "1. In class, we derived the maximum likelihood estimate $\\theta_{ML}$ for the parameter $\\theta$ of a model in which the probability of observing x spikes in response to the presentation of a stimulus is given by a linear-Poisson model: $$P(x) = Pois(\\lambda), \\lambda = \\theta s $$\n",
    "given a set of datapoints ${x_i, s_i}$. Use the same approach to derive an expression that $\\theta_{ML}$ must satisfy for the linear-nonlinear-Poisson model: $$P(x) = Pois(\\lambda), \\lambda = f(\\theta s),$$ where $f$ is some known function. The solution will be an implicit expression for $\\theta_{ML}$ involving $f, f', x_i$ and $s_i$."
